Covers:\n- Large file refactoring (10+ files over 400 lines)\n- Code duplication elimination (9 major duplication patterns)\n- Dead code removal (~40 unused exports)\n- Test coverage improvements (CLI utilities, Lexical nodes)\n- Documentation gaps (5 modules lacking docs)\n- Legacy patterns cleanup (any usage, inconsistent handler patterns)\n\n## Priority Areas\n1. content-extractor.ts (1031 lines) - highest impact refactor\n2. Duplicate content creation functions (6+ locations)\n3. CLI utilities missing tests (cli-installer.ts, input.ts)\n4. Error system consolidation (2 separate ErrorCode enums)\n\n## Refined Dependency Graph\n\n### Wave 1: Fully Parallel (No blockers - start immediately)\nThese 22 tasks can run in parallel with no dependencies:\n\n**P1 (Critical Path):**\n- g6j.1: Refactor content-extractor.ts → UNBLOCKS g6j.28\n- g6j.5: Merge CLI ErrorCode enum into shared package\n- g6j.21: Add unit tests for cli-installer.ts\n- g6j.22: Add unit tests for CLI input.ts\n\n**P1 Content Consolidation (parallel with each other):**\n- g6j.7: Consolidate createDailyContent → UNBLOCKS g6j.12, g6j.2\n- g6j.8: Consolidate createMeetingContent → UNBLOCKS g6j.12, g6j.2\n- g6j.9: Consolidate createPersonContent → UNBLOCKS g6j.12, g6j.2\n\n**P2 Independent:**\n- g6j.3: Split TableKeyboardPlugin.tsx into modules\n- g6j.6: Consolidate wrapError function\n- g6j.10: Standardize createEmptyContent\n- g6j.16: Remove deprecated LexicalState/LexicalNode\n- g6j.23-26: Unit tests (config.ts, PersonMentionNode, InlineLinkNode, tasksHandlers)\n- g6j.27: Fix skipped rollback tests\n- g6j.33: Refactor handlers to use EngineOrchestrator\n\n**P3 Dead Code Removal (fully parallel):**\n- g6j.13: Remove unused error exports\n- g6j.14: Remove unused date utility exports\n- g6j.15: Remove unused note type guards\n- g6j.17: Clean up storage-fs internal exports\n\n**P3 Documentation (fully parallel):**\n- g6j.29: JSDoc for createCLI\n- g6j.30: JSDoc for createWindow\n- g6j.31: Document magic numbers\n- g6j.34: Convert Promise .then() to async/await\n\n**P3 Hooks Refactoring:**\n- g6j.4: Extract autocomplete hooks\n- g6j.11: Consolidate desktop logger\n\n### Wave 2: After Content Consolidation (g6j.7, g6j.8, g6j.9)\n- g6j.2: Consolidate note-factory.ts patterns (needs content functions)\n- g6j.12: Migrate test helpers to @scribe/test-utils\n\n### Wave 3: After g6j.1\n- g6j.28: Document escapeMarkdownText algorithm (after refactor)\n\n### Wave 4: After g6j.12 + g6j.2\n- g6j.32: Create test utilities to eliminate `as any` casts\n\n## Closed as Already Done\n- g6j.18, g6j.19, g6j.20 (design-system primitive tests already exist)\n\n## Recommended Execution Order\n1. Start Wave 1 tasks in parallel (max parallelism)\n2. As g6j.7, g6j.8, g6j.9 complete → start g6j.2, g6j.12\n3. As g6j.1 completes → start g6j.28\n4.

{"id":"scribe-hao","title":"Sync Engine: Multi-Device Synchronization with Offline-First Support","description":"# Sync Engine Epic (GitHub Issue #54)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nDesign and implement a sync engine for Scribe, enabling multi-device synchronization with offline-first support. This lays the groundwork for a future mobile client.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Goals\n\n### Primary Goals\n1. **Offline-first**: Users can edit notes without connectivity; changes sync when back online\n2. **Multi-device**: Same vault accessible from desktop (now) and mobile (future)\n3. **Real-time**: Changes propagate quickly when online (polling every 30s for v1)\n4. **Conflict handling**: Concurrent edits to the same note don't lose data\n5. **Opt-in \u0026 disableable**: Sync MUST be disabled by default and easily toggled off\n6. **Data ownership**: Architecture should support future self-hosting option\n\n### Why This Matters for Scribe\n- Users expect their notes to be available everywhere\n- Mobile is the most requested feature - sync is the foundation\n- Offline-first respects user autonomy and works in any network condition\n- Enterprise/corporate users need explicit opt-in for data governance\n\n---\n\n## Architectural Decisions (Pre-Made)\n\n### 1. Sync Model\n- **Client-server** topology with central server as source of truth\n- **Document-level sync** (v1): Each note syncs as a whole JSON blob\n- **Optimistic concurrency**: baseVersion comparison for conflict detection\n\n### 2. Versioning Scheme\nTwo-tier versioning:\n- `note.sync.version`: Per-note monotonic counter for conflict detection\n- `serverSequence`: Global server sequence for efficient pull (\"give me changes since X\")\n\n### 3. Storage Locations\n- **Sync Database**: `{vault}/derived/sync.sqlite3` (follows derived data pattern)\n- **Sync Config**: `{vault}/.scribe/sync.json` (vault-level, not app-level)\n- **Package**: `packages/engine-sync/` (follows engine-* naming convention)\n\n### 4. Authentication (v1)\n- Simple API key with PBKDF2 hash\n- Workers-compatible (no bcrypt native bindings)\n- OAuth can be added later as alternative login method\n\n### 5. Infrastructure\n- Cloudflare Workers + D1 (SQLite at edge) + KV (session cache)\n- R2 for future blob storage (attachments/images)\n\n### 6. Tasks Handling\n- Tasks (`vault/derived/tasks.jsonl`) are NOT synced\n- Re-derived on each device from synced notes via TaskIndex\n- Avoids data duplication and consistency issues\n\n### 7. Conflict Resolution\n- Store conflicts for user resolution (no auto-merge in v1)\n- Three options: Keep Mine, Keep Theirs, Keep Both\n- Side-by-side comparison view (read-only)\n- Delete vs Edit conflicts handled specially\n\n### 8. Tombstone TTL\n- 90 days for deleted notes\n- Notes deleted while a device is offline \u003e90 days will reappear as \"restored\"\n- Acceptable tradeoff, documented in UI\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems to Extend\n1. **BaseNote interface**: Add `sync?: SyncMetadata` field\n2. **EngineOrchestrator**: Add syncEngine integration, queue changes after save\n3. **HandlerDependencies**: Add `syncEngine: SyncEngine | null`\n4. **IPC Contract**: Add sync channels and SyncAPI interface\n5. **EngineName type**: Add 'sync' to the union\n6. **ErrorCode enum**: Add sync-specific error codes\n\n### New Systems to Create\n1. **packages/engine-sync/**: Client-side sync engine\n2. **apps/sync-server/**: Cloudflare Workers server\n3. **Sync UI components**: Status indicator, conflict modal, settings panel\n\n---\n\n## v1 Scope\n\n### INCLUDED\n- Document-level sync (whole note as unit)\n- HTTP polling (30s interval when online)\n- Push/pull REST endpoints\n- Cloudflare Workers + D1 + KV infrastructure\n- API key authentication (PBKDF2)\n- Offline queue with exponential backoff retry\n- Conflict detection \u0026 storage\n- Basic resolution UI (keep mine/theirs/both)\n- Side-by-side comparison (read-only)\n- Delete vs edit conflict handling\n- Type-specific sync (DailyNote, MeetingNote reference validation)\n- Migration strategy for existing vaults\n- Network detection and reconnect sync\n- IPC contract extension\n- Progress UI for initial sync\n\n### DEFERRED (Post-v1)\n- Attachment/image sync (requires R2 integration)\n- WebSocket real-time push (reduces polling)\n- Block-level CRDT merge (complex, different architecture)\n- Auto-merge for DailyNotes (requires semantic understanding)\n- Inline diff highlighting (nice-to-have)\n- Manual merge editor (complex UI)\n- OAuth authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.)\n- End-to-end encryption (requires key management)\n- Self-hosting option (config + docs)\n- Shared/collaborative vaults (different sync model)\n- Real-time collaboration (OT/CRDT, different problem)\n\n---\n\n## Phase Overview\n\n### Phase 0: Opt-in Guards (CRITICAL - First)\nEnsure sync is disabled by default and no network calls occur when disabled.\nThis protects enterprise/corporate users with data governance requirements.\n\n### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure\nCreate the `packages/engine-sync/` package with core types, database, and engine interface.\nThis is the foundation that everything else builds on.\n\n### Phase 2: Client Integration\nIntegrate SyncEngine with EngineOrchestrator, IPC handlers, and main process.\nConnect the sync engine to the existing Scribe architecture.\n\n### Phase 3: Server\nCreate `apps/sync-server/` with Cloudflare Workers, D1 database, and push/pull endpoints.\nBuild the cloud infrastructure that handles synchronization.\n\n### Phase 4: UI\nBuild the user-facing sync components: status indicator, conflict resolution, settings.\nMake sync visible and controllable for users.\n\n### Phase 5: Testing \u0026 Polish\nComprehensive testing of sync flows, conflict resolution, and edge cases.\nEnsure the feature is production-ready.\n\n---\n\n## Dependency Graph Summary\n\n```\nPhase 0 (Opt-in Guards)\n    └── Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)\n            ├── Phase 2 (Client Integration)\n            │       └── Phase 4 (UI)\n            │               └── Phase 5 (Testing)\n            └── Phase 3 (Server)\n                    └── Phase 5 (Testing)\n```\n\nPhase 1 subtasks have internal dependencies (types before implementations).\nPhases 2 and 3 can be developed in parallel after Phase 1.\nPhase 4 and 5 require both client and server work to be complete.\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Opt-in works**: Fresh install has sync disabled, no network calls occur\n2. **Enable flow works**: User can enable sync, create account, initial sync completes\n3. **Edit flow works**: Changes sync within 30s, visible on second device\n4. **Conflict handling works**: Concurrent edits detected, user can resolve\n5. **Offline works**: Changes queue locally, sync when back online\n6. **Type-specific works**: DailyNotes, MeetingNotes sync with reference validation\n7. **Migration works**: Existing vaults can enable sync, all notes upload\n8. **Disable works**: User can disable sync, no more network calls, data stays local\n\n---\n\n## Related Future Work\n\n- Mobile client (iOS/Android) - shares engine-sync package\n- Web client - shares engine-sync package (uses sql.js instead of better-sqlite3)\n- End-to-end encryption - separate feature flag\n- Shared vaults / collaboration - different sync model required","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:16.861102-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:16.861102-06:00"}
{"id":"scribe-hao.1","title":"[Phase 0.1] Verify SyncEngine is not initialized unless explicitly enabled","description":"# [Phase 0.1] Verify SyncEngine is not initialized unless explicitly enabled\n\n## Problem Statement\nSync MUST be disabled by default to protect enterprise/corporate users with data governance requirements. This task ensures no sync-related code runs unless the user explicitly enables sync.\n\n## Why This is Critical (P0)\n- **Corporate/enterprise environments** have data governance policies prohibiting external sync\n- **Regulated industries** (healthcare, finance, legal) have strict data residency requirements\n- **Privacy-conscious users** want all data to remain local\n- **Zero network calls when disabled** - no sync-related network traffic whatsoever\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Check sync config before initialization\n```typescript\n// apps/desktop/electron/main/src/main.ts\n\nasync function initializeEngines(vaultPath: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  // ... existing engine initialization ...\n  \n  // ONLY initialize sync engine if explicitly enabled in vault config\n  const syncConfig = await loadSyncConfig(vaultPath);\n  if (syncConfig?.enabled === true) {\n    deps.syncEngine = await createSyncEngine({\n      vaultPath,\n      serverUrl: syncConfig.serverUrl,\n      // ... other config\n    });\n  } else {\n    // Explicitly set to null - sync is disabled\n    deps.syncEngine = null;\n    logger.info('Sync disabled - no sync engine initialized');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add sync config loading helper\n```typescript\n// packages/engine-sync/src/sync-config.ts\n\ninterface SyncConfig {\n  enabled: boolean;\n  serverUrl: string;\n  apiKeyHash: string;\n  deviceId: string;\n  lastSyncSequence: number;\n  enabledAt: number;\n}\n\nexport async function loadSyncConfig(vaultPath: string): Promise\u003cSyncConfig | null\u003e {\n  const configPath = path.join(vaultPath, '.scribe', 'sync.json');\n  try {\n    const content = await fs.readFile(configPath, 'utf-8');\n    return JSON.parse(content) as SyncConfig;\n  } catch {\n    return null; // Config doesn't exist = sync never enabled\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update HandlerDependencies\nEnsure syncEngine is nullable and handlers check before using:\n```typescript\n// apps/desktop/electron/main/src/handlers/types.ts\nexport interface HandlerDependencies {\n  // ... existing deps ...\n  syncEngine: SyncEngine | null;  // Explicitly nullable\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Criteria\n- [ ] Fresh install has no sync.json config\n- [ ] SyncEngine is not instantiated on app start\n- [ ] No sync-related imports are loaded when disabled (verify bundle)\n- [ ] deps.syncEngine is null when sync is disabled\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `apps/desktop/electron/main/src/main.ts`\n- `apps/desktop/electron/main/src/handlers/types.ts`\n- `packages/engine-sync/src/sync-config.ts` (NEW)\n\n## Dependencies\n- None (this is the first task)\n\n## UNBLOCKS\n- scribe-hao.2 (Verify no network calls)\n- scribe-hao.3 (Add sync toggle to Settings)\n- scribe-hao.5 (Create engine-sync package)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:17.046836-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:49.030285-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"scribe-hao.1","depends_on_id":"scribe-hao","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:17.047207-06:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

Create SyncSettings component\n```typescript\n// apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/Settings/SyncSettings.tsx\n\nexport function SyncSettings() {\n  const [syncEnabled, setSyncEnabled] = useState(false);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  \n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    window.scribe.sync.getStatus().then(status =\u003e {\n      setSyncEnabled(status.state !== 'disabled');\n      setLoading(false);\n    });\n  }, []);\n  \n  const handleToggle = async (enabled: boolean) =\u003e {\n    if (enabled) {\n      // Show enable flow - account creation/login\n      // This is handled by scribe-hao.38 (SyncSettingsPanel)\n    } else {\n      await window.scribe.sync.disable();\n      setSyncEnabled(false);\n    }\n  };\n  \n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className={styles.syncSettings}\u003e\n      \u003ch2\u003eSync Settings\u003c/h2\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className={styles.toggleRow}\u003e\n        \u003cToggle\n          checked={syncEnabled}\n          onChange={handleToggle}\n          disabled={loading}\n          label=\"Enable cloud sync\"\n          description=\"Sync notes across your devices\"\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \n      {!syncEnabled \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003cp className={styles.privacyNote}\u003e\n          When disabled, all notes stay on this device only.\n          No data is sent to any server.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      )}\n      \n      {syncEnabled \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003cSyncStatusSection /\u003e\n      )}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add to Settings panel\n```typescript\n// apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx\n\nexport function Settings() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className={styles.settings}\u003e\n      \u003cGeneralSettings /\u003e\n      \u003cSyncSettings /\u003e\n      \u003cCLISettings /\u003e\n      {/* ... other settings */}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. IPC integration (uses sync API from scribe-hao.17)\nThe toggle calls:\n- `window.scribe.sync.getStatus()` to check current state\n- `window.scribe.sync.enable(options)` to enable sync\n- `window.scribe.sync.disable()` to disable sync\n\n## UX Considerations\n- Toggle should be prominent but not pushy\n- No account creation prompts unless user clicks \"Enable\"\n- Clear privacy messaging when disabled\n- Show current sync status when enabled (pending changes, last sync time)\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- `apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/Settings/SyncSettings.tsx` (NEW)\n- `apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/Settings/SyncSettings.css.ts` (NEW)\n- `apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx` (MODIFY)\n\n## Dependencies\n- scribe-hao.1 (Verify SyncEngine not initialized)\n- scribe-hao.17 (IPC contract with SyncAPI)\n\n## UNBLOCKS\n- scribe-hao.4 (Verify no account prompts)\n- scribe-hao.38 (Full SyncSettingsPanel with account flow)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:17.39825-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:21.161979-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"scribe-hao.3","depends_on_id":"scribe-hao","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-27T21:28:17.398614-06:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

Before removing it, we need a documented migration path.\n\n## Context\n\n### What Changed\nOriginally, notes had:\n```typescript\ninterface NoteMetadata {\n  title: string;  // DEPRECATED\n  // ... other fields\n}\n```\n\nNow, titles are derived from:\n1. First heading in content\n2. Filename fallback\n3. Note type default (\"Untitled Daily\", \"Untitled Meeting\")\n\n### Why This Matters\n- Existing notes may have `metadata.title` set\n- Migrations need to handle legacy format\n- Users upgrading from old versions need data preserved\n\n## Current References\n\n| File | Line | Usage |\n|------|------|-------|\n| `packages/shared/src/types/note-types.ts` | ~45 | Type definition with @deprecated |\n| `packages/storage-fs/src/note-migrator.ts` | ~32 | Migration reads old title |\n| `apps/desktop/renderer/src/hooks/useNoteTitle.ts` | ~15 | Fallback to metadata.title |\n| `apps/desktop/test-helpers.ts` | ~89 | Test factories set title |\n| `packages/test-utils/src/note-factory.ts` | ~156 | Test factories set title |\n\n## Documentation to Create\n\n### 1.

This was redundant \nbecause titles are extractable from note content.\n\n## Migration Path\n\n### Phase 1: Dual Read (Current)\n- New code reads title from content first heading\n- Falls back to `metadata.title` for legacy notes\n- Migration code preserves both during format upgrades\n\n### Phase 2: Write Removal (Next Minor Version)\n- Stop writing `metadata.title` on save\n- Continue reading for backwards compatibility\n- Update note-factory test helpers\n\n### Phase 3: Full Removal (Next Major Version)\n- Remove `metadata.title` from type definitions\n- Remove fallback read logic\n- Migration script to clean old notes\n\n## Timeline\n- Phase 1: v1.x (current)\n- Phase 2: v1.x+1\n- Phase 3: v2.0\n\n## Testing\nEach phase requires:\n- Unit tests for migration logic\n- Integration tests with legacy note fixtures\n- Manual testing with real user vaults\n```\n\n### 2.

{"id":"scribe-roo","title":"Settings Page - Full Implementation (GH Issue #50)","description":"# Settings Page Epic\n\n## Overview\nThis epic implements a comprehensive Settings page for the Scribe desktop application, accessible via a gear icon in the sidebar footer. The settings page opens as a full-screen modal with a VS Code/macOS System Settings-style sidebar navigation pattern.\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\nCurrently, Scribe has limited configurability exposed to users:\n- Theme toggle is buried in the sidebar footer\n- Vault location is hardcoded/undiscoverable\n- Update checking requires manual intervention\n- No centralized place for user preferences\n\nA proper Settings page serves several goals:\n1. **Discoverability** - Users can find and modify all app preferences in one place\n2. **Professional UX** - Aligns with user expectations from VS Code, macOS, and modern Electron apps\n3. **Foundation for Growth** - Establishes patterns for future settings (CLI, spellcheck, plugins, etc.)\n4. **Vault Management** - Critical for users with multiple vaults or who need to relocate their data\n\n## Architecture Decision: Full-Screen Modal Pattern\nWe chose a full-screen modal (hiding the sidebar) rather than:\n- **Inline panel**: Would compete with editor space, complex state management\n- **Separate window**: Electron multi-window adds complexity, feels disconnected\n- **Route-based**: Would require router setup, loses context of current session\n\nThe full-screen modal pattern:\n- Familiar from macOS System Preferences, VS Code Settings\n- Clear entry/exit points (gear icon → modal → X/Escape)\n- Can reuse existing Overlay primitive for backdrop and escape handling\n- Sidebar navigation scales well as settings sections grow\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Foundation)\nBuild reusable primitives and IPC infrastructure that enable the feature:\n1. **SegmentedControl** - New design system primitive for theme picker\n2. **Folder Picker IPC** - dialog:selectFolder for vault management\n3. **Vault IPC Channels** - vault:getPath, vault:setPath, vault:create\n\n### Phase 2: UI Shell (Scaffolding)\nBuild the settings page structure without full functionality:\n1. **Sidebar gear icon** - Replace footer with settings trigger\n2. **SettingsPage modal** - Full-screen container with sidebar layout\n3. **Section navigation** - General and Changelog sections\n\n### Phase 3: Settings Functionality (Features)\nImplement actual settings with full behavior:\n1. **Theme setting** - SegmentedControl with immediate apply\n2. **Version + Updates** - Display version, check/install updates\n3. **Vault display** - Show current path (read-only initially)\n4. **Vault switching** - Full hot-reload implementation\n5. **Create new vault** - initializeVault integration\n\n## Key Technical Challenges\n\n### Engine Hot-Reload (Most Complex)\nSwitching vaults at runtime requires:\n- Proper cleanup of existing FileSystemVault instance\n- Re-initialization of SearchEngine, GraphEngine, TaskEngine\n- Renderer state refresh (note list, current note, etc.)\n- Graceful handling of \"current note doesn't exist in new vault\"\n\n**Mitigation**: We'll implement vault switching in waves:\n1. First: Display current path (read-only)\n2. Second: Full switching with engine hot-reload\n3. Fallback: If hot-reload proves too risky, require app restart\n\n### State Synchronization\nSettings changes need to:\n- Persist to config.json (already exists via app:setConfig)\n- Reflect immediately in UI (theme, vault)\n- Handle errors gracefully (invalid vault, failed update)\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. Gear icon visible in sidebar footer, clickable to open settings\n2. Settings modal opens full-screen, closes via X or Escape\n3. Theme switching works immediately with Dark/Light/System options\n4. Version displayed, update checking functional\n5. Vault path displayed, switching to valid vaults works\n6. Create new vault initializes structure correctly\n\n## Out of Scope (Future Work)\n- CLI installation from Settings (separate feature)\n- Actual changelog content (placeholder only)\n- Keyboard shortcuts customization\n- Plugin management\n- Multiple simultaneous vaults\n\n## References\n- GitHub Issue: #50\n- Existing IPC contract: packages/shared/src/ipc-contract.ts\n- Theme system: packages/design-system/src/ThemeProvider.tsx\n- Update hooks: apps/desktop/renderer/src/hooks/useUpdateStatus.ts\n- Vault utilities: packages/storage-fs/src/vault.ts\n\n## Dependency Graph Summary\nWave 1 (Parallel - No blockers): SegmentedControl, Sidebar gear icon, Folder picker IPC, Vault IPC basics\nWave 2 (Depends on Wave 1): SettingsPage shell, Theme setting\nWave 3 (Depends on Wave 2): Version/Update section, Vault display\nWave 4 (Depends on Wave 3): Vault switching (engine hot-reload)\nWave 5 (Depends on Wave 4): Create new vault","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-23T14:56:09.822152-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:23:28.900336-06:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:23:28.900336-06:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

However, for clarity:\n```tsx\n{/* Main app UI */}\n\u003cSidebar ... /\u003e\n\u003cmain ... /\u003e\n\n{/* Overlays (render last for z-index clarity) */}\n\u003cCommandPalette ... /\u003e\n\u003cSettingsPage ... /\u003e\n\u003cToast ... /\u003e\n```\n\n### ErrorBoundary\nConsider wrapping SettingsPage in ErrorBoundary:\n```tsx\n\u003cErrorBoundary name=\"Settings\"\u003e\n  \u003cSettingsPage ... /\u003e\n\u003c/ErrorBoundary\u003e\n```\n\n## BLOCKED BY\n- scribe-roo.4 (Sidebar gear icon) - Need onOpenSettings prop\n- scribe-roo.5 (SettingsPage shell) - Need component to render\n- scribe-roo.6 (useSettingsPage hook) - Need state management\n\n## Files\n- apps/desktop/renderer/src/App.tsx","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T14:56:10.306119-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:23:28.900336-06:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:23:28.900336-06:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}
