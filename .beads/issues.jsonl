{"id":"scribe-arr","title":"Decompose CommandPalette.tsx into mode-specific panel components","description":"The CommandPalette component in apps/desktop/renderer/src/components/CommandPalette/CommandPalette.tsx is ~1339 lines with 6 distinct modes mixed into one monolithic component. This makes it difficult to understand, test, and extend.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe component manages these distinct modes with significant state and rendering logic for each:\n\n1. **Command Mode** (default): Command list with fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, 'create daily note' option\n2. **File-Browse Mode**: Note listing with recent notes, fuzzy search via Fuse.js, delete button per item\n3. **Delete-Browse Mode**: Note selection for deletion (similar to file-browse but different click behavior)\n4. **Delete-Confirm Mode**: Confirmation dialog for note deletion\n5. **Person-Browse Mode**: People listing with fuzzy search\n6. **Prompt-Input Mode**: Text input modal for creating entities\n\n### State Complexity (~25 useState calls)\n- query, selectedIndex, searchResults (command mode)\n- allNotes, isLoadingNotes, selectedNoteIndex, displayedNotes (file-browse)\n- allPeople, isLoadingPeople, selectedPersonIndex, fuzzyPeopleResults (person-browse)\n- pendingDeleteNote, returnMode, isDeleting (delete modes)\n- promptInputValue (prompt mode)\n- showCreateDailyOption, createDailyIsoDate (date search feature)\n\n### Duplicated Patterns\n- renderFileBrowseResults() and renderDeleteBrowseResults() are 90% identical\n- Keyboard handlers for file-browse and delete-browse are nearly identical\n- Fuse.js index setup is duplicated for notes and people\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nExtract mode-specific logic into dedicated components:\n\n### 1. CommandModePanel.tsx\n- Command rendering and selection\n- Search results rendering\n- 'Create daily note' option\n- State: query, selectedIndex, searchResults, showCreateDailyOption\n\n### 2. FileBrowsePanel.tsx\n- Recent notes display\n- Fuzzy search with Fuse.js\n- Note item rendering with delete button\n- State: allNotes, selectedNoteIndex, fuzzySearchResults\n\n### 3. DeleteBrowsePanel.tsx (or reuse FileBrowsePanel with mode prop)\n- Can share FileBrowsePanel with an onSelect callback difference\n\n### 4. DeleteConfirmDialog.tsx\n- Confirmation UI\n- State: pendingDeleteNote, isDeleting\n\n### 5. PersonBrowsePanel.tsx\n- People listing and fuzzy search\n- State: allPeople, selectedPersonIndex, fuzzyPeopleResults\n\n### 6. PromptInputPanel.tsx\n- Text input modal\n- State: promptInputValue\n\n### 7. Shared hook: useFuzzySearch.ts\n- Extract Fuse.js index creation and search logic\n- Reusable for notes, people, and future searchable lists\n\n### CommandPalette.tsx (refactored)\n- Mode router that renders the appropriate panel\n- Manages only: isOpen, mode, onClose\n- Passes callbacks to child panels\n\nExpected result: CommandPalette.tsx reduced to ~150-200 lines, with each panel being ~100-200 lines.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-12T21:00:08.135479-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-12T22:12:03.310454-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-12T22:12:03.310454-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"scribe-arr","depends_on_id":"scribe-0w9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-12T21:00:11.564444-06:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"scribe-arr","depends_on_id":"scribe-1sh","type":"related","created_at":"2025-12-12T21:42:09.6592-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
