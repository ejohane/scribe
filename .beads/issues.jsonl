{"id":"redesign-1","title":"Auto-Update for macOS Desktop App","description":"Implement automatic application updates for the macOS desktop app. When a new version is released on GitHub, the app will silently download the update in the background and display a subtle notification in the sidebar footer. Users can then restart the app at their convenience to apply the update.\n\nGoals:\n1. Enable seamless updates without manual DMG downloads\n2. Provide a non-intrusive update notification UX\n3. Check for updates on startup and periodically while running\n4. Allow users to dismiss and defer updates\n5. Respect user workflow by never forcing restarts\n\nArchitecture: Uses electron-updater with GitHub Releases as the update provider.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-05T06:31:29.84174-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-05T19:43:10.184939-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-05T19:43:10.184939-06:00"}
